Please see below for abstracts for each course.

### 1) Algorithms part 1
This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Coursework are finished in `java` and sorting and searching algorithms like 'Quick sort', 'Merge sort' and 'Balanced searched tree' and 'kd tree' are implemented in `java`.

### 2) Big Data Integration Processing
This is a beginner course which aim to
- Describe the connections between data management operations and the big data processing patterns needed to utilize them in large-scale analytical applications
- Identify when a big data problem needs data integration
- Execute simple big data integration and processing on Hadoop and Spark platforms.

I handed in several jupyter notebook from week 3 to week 6, involving very basic tasks of mapreduce and processing data-stream using `pyspark`, `mongodb 4.2` and `python 3.6`

### 3) Convolutional Neural Network
A classic course designed by Andrew Ng, as an entrance to understand basic CNN throughly, and in order to know how to apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks.
Several jupyter notebook are served as homeworks and additional materials for this course.
I used `keras` and `python 3.6` to finish the assignments, including basic car detection by YOLO, neural style transfer (overwhelmed by GANs nowadays) and face recognition  called FaceNet.
